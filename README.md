# University Project: Tourist Websites

**Team Members:** Sebastien, Imene, Crinu.

## Project Overview

Our objective is to develop three tourist websites to recommend various locations. This project will be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Guidelines

- **Original Work:** We are required to create the project entirely on our own, without using any templates or external assistance (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot).
- **Research:** We are permitted to refer to GitHub repositories and Google for guidance, but all code must be written manually to ensure a thorough learning experience.
